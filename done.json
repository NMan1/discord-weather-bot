    "846": "any new thoughts about what you did?",
    "847": "Not sure. Um, I had a shower...",
    "848": "and some sorbet?",
    "849": "I think you're getting your dates mixed up.",
    "850": "But how?",
    "851": "Where do you place... Paul that night?",
    "852": "According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary,",

    "870": "And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night.",
    "871": "Personally, I think the guy went a little nutso.",
    "872": "Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever.",
    "873": "Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think...",

    "896": "I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn't I? With Spicey?",
    "897": "Well, maybe not with Spicey, but definitely at Surf Bar. You know, Surf Bar.",
    "898": "Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now. It's terrible.",
    "899": "Went to a birthday party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.",
    "900": "This is nicer than your other apartment.",
    "901": "Oh, it's not that nice.",
    "902": "Where did you two meet? Oh, God. We met at...",
    "903": "oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby in '85, or '86.",
    "904": "You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number.",
    "905": "What do you mean? She was a hot number.",
    "906": "If you had a platinum card, she'd give you a blow job. This girl worked in a tanning salon.",
    "907": "What do you do?",
    "908": "She's my... cousin.",

    "913": "It's 3:00 in the morning. He's a goddamn drug dealer. These are his peak hours.",
    "914": "Don't tell him you're here. Why would I?",
    "915": "This tastes weird.",
    "916": "Harley, it's me. I need your services. Translate that however you want.",
    "917": "- I'm at... - Paul Allen's.",
    "918": "Who? Paul Allen's.",
    "919": "I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later.",

    "925": "I would take a Halcyon. Listen.",
    "926": "I would just like to see...",
    "927": "the two of you... get it on.",
    "928": "What's wrong with that?",

    "931": "Don't you find Christie attractive?",
    "932": "Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood for a lewd conversation.",
    "933": "Come on.",
    "934": "I think it'd be a turn-on. Does he do this all the time?",
    "935": "Christie, you're not drinking your wine.",
    "936": "Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?",
    "937": "No. I'm not a lesbian.",
    "938": "Why would you think I would be into that?",
    "939": "Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.",
    "940": "Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.",
    "941": "Did you know...",
    "942": "that Whitney Houston's debut LP...",
    "943": "called simply Whitney Houston...",
